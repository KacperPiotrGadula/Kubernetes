# Cloud Native Aplication

Application developed for: 

1) Cloud
2) On-premise

4) Hybrid cloud

# Cloud Native is not just microservices

1) Containers, thanks to which we can run applications in
any infrastructure

2) Patterns, such as the Twelve-Factor App

3) Container orchestration, which is necessary with a large
number of containers

4) Microservices (yes, microservices are also one of the
cloud native foundations, but not the only one)

5) Backend services (databases, caches, queues, monitoring,
analytics)

6) Automation, classic CD / CD and GitOps approach
